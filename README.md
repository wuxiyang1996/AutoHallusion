## Dependency
Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

OR

1. Install **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** (We use 2.2.2)
2. Install object detection model **[OWL-ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/owlvit)**: `pip install transformer` and follow the instructions provided in the [link](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/owlvit).
3. Install LVLMs: `pip install openai` or other LVLMs to be evaluated.
4. Other dependencies: `pip install opencv-python numpy tqdm pillow rembg`

## Benchmark
We provide a benchmark including hallucination cases created by abnormal object insertion, paired object insertion and 
correlated object removal strategies, from both synthetic and real-world images. 

To keep evaluation simple, we only provide the question in form of yes/no questions.

## Demo
We provide a few light-weight demos to help users quickly understand the usage of different strategies provided by 
our AutoHallusion pipeline and craft hallucination cases.

### Hugging Face
We provide **[an interactive online Hugging Face demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/wuxiyang/AUTOHALLUSION)** for users 
to craft hallucination cases easily using either strategies of AutoHallusion, with synthetic images generated from text 
or uploaded images.

### Jupyter Notebook
We provide three jupyter notebooks **[Abnormal Object Insertion](./abnormal_obj_insertion.ipynb)**, 
**[Paired Object Insertion](./paired_obj_insertion.ipynb)** and **[Correlated Object Removal](./corr_obj_removal.ipynb)**.
We provide illustrative comments along with each code block with visualization of results to help users understand the 
purpose of each step throughout the whole hallucination crafting procedure. 

## Usage
### Hallucination Case Crafting
We provide codebase to automatically scale up the benchmark using AutoHallusion.
{strategy name} could be replaced with **Abnormal Object Insertion**, **Paired Object Insertion** and 
**Correlated Object Removal**.

`run_{strategy name}.py`: Hyper-parameters and experiment flags for hallucination case crafting.
`main_{strategy name}.py`: Main function for hallucination case crafting, including the scene image generation, image 
manipulation, question construction and hallucination detection. The specific strategy is determined by chosen 
hyper-parameters and experiment flags.

### Utilities
`utils_merge.py`: A general function to determine LVLM-related functions for scene image generation, object prompting, 
VQA, etc. The specific LVLM is decided by `object thinking` (for scene and object prompting) and `image caption` 
(for VQA tasks) in the hyper-parameters.
`utils_{model name}_clean.py`: All LVLM-related functions for scene image generation, object prompting, VQA, etc., given 
the LVLM specified by `{model name}`.
`utils_eval.py`: All evaluation functions for hallucination detection, supported by **GPT-4V-Turbo**.
`utils.py`: All other non-LVLM-related functions, including object detection, image editing, background removal, ground
truth generation etc.

## Leaderboard
### Evaluation
We evaluate each model's performance over benchmark created by AutoHallusion. The evaluation procedure for each model 
to get the results presented in the leaderboard includes:

**Step 1**: Install the **[Questions and Annotations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17yrpbLrtd4MmqNFE1ET5qxksea7i5u-x/view?usp=drive_link)**
and **[Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HsbIPw8wslRpBswSZygp6YhBMqUHvfVW/view?usp=drive_link)**. Setup model to be evaluated.

**Step 2**: We run the VQA tasks for each model over the question-image pair in the benchmark to get the answer, 
using the inference code for each model we provided **[GPT-4V-Turbo](./eval/autohall_gpt.py)**, 
**[Gemini Pro Vision](./eval/autohall_gemini.py)** and **[Claude 3](./eval/autohall_claude3.py)**. 
Results are stored in the `autohallusion_data_{model name}_res.json`.

**Step 3**: We run **[evaluation code](./eval/eval_code.py)** that uses **GPT-4V-Turbo** to determine if the answer produced
by the models conveys the same meaning as the ground truth. Results produced by `autohallusion_data_{model name}_res_evaluated.json`.
are presented as breakdowns of accuracy values over examples from different categories, as presented in the leaderboard.

### Metric
The metrics on the leaderboard we provide include:
* **Overall Accuracy:** The question-answering accuracy over the whole benchmark.
* **Breakdown (over Synthetic/Real-world Dataset)**
    * **Overall Accuracy:** The question-answering accuracy over examples generated from **Synthetic/Real-world images**.
    * **Existence Accuracy:** The question-answering accuracy for **existence questions** over examples generated from **Synthetic/Real-world images**.
    * **Spatial Relation Accuracy:** The question-answering accuracy for **spatial relation questions** over examples generated from **Synthetic/Real-world images**.
